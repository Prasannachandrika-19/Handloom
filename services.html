As civilization progressed, handloom weaving techniques developed independently in different regions of the world:<br>

1. Founder of Handlooms: The origins of handloom in the Indian subcontinent may be traced back to the Indus Valley Civilization, according to archaeological findings. Weavers received royal support with the rise of the Mughal empire, resulting in the invention of new textiles such as 'Mulmul,' 'Benarsi Brocade,' and 'Jamawar,' among others..<br>

2. First Handloom Cloth in India: Pochampally saree
The Pochampally saree is the first handloom cloth patented in India.<br>

3. India's Famous Handloom: Varanasi is celebrated for its exquisite handloom products, particularly the Benarasi silk sarees, zari embroidery, and brocades. It is a hub for weaving crafts, where skilled artisans weave gold and silver threads into fabrics commonly chosen for Indian weddings<br>

The handloom industry produces a wide range of unique designs and patterns. The handloom fabrics are known for their intricate designs, vibrant colors, and high quality. The products are often valued for their aesthetic appeal and cultural significance.<br>

The prices of raw cotton shot up and Indian weavers were forced to buy raw cotton at exorbitant prices. In most cases, they were unable to pay.

Other factors such as rapid and manifold increase in the prices of raw material, poor awareness of buying patterns/trends in the market, inadequate variety in designs, low grade technology, and high cost of pro· duction have led to handlooms becoming an unviable proposition.
Climate change is a major threat to the planet and its life forms, as it causes extreme weather events, sea level rise, melting of ice caps, and shifts in ecosystems. To limit global warming to 2°C or less, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the use of renewable energy sources.<br>

The study found that the main problems faced are lack of working capital, increasing price of raw materials, stiff competition from the power loom sector, lack of organizational capacity, and lack of policy support and it also indicates that the handloom weavers are not happy with the financial benefits of this ....<br></p>
